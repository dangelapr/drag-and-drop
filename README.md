WHY:
I was working on a Kanban board project and I wanted to make the tasks on the board drag and droppable but I was struggling to add the functionality, so I decided to isolate the feature as its own project to make it a bit simpler. I will add this feature to my Kanban board once I've got it working smoothly and I fully understand the code.


new things I learned while makign this: 

-add the js script at the top with the stylesheet link and give it the defer attribute to prevent it from loading until the HTML is loaded

-I learned how to get the movable cursor!
